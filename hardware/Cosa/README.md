Che Cosa?
=========

Cosa is an object-oriented platform for Arduino that supports an
event-driven programming paradigm with simple finite state
machines. It contains a rich set of classes to support rapid
prototyping of Internet-of-Things devices. Cosa supports the following
AVR/Atmega328P internal hardware modules; all pin modes, Digital,
Analog and Interrupt Pins, Analog Comparator, PWM, Watchdog, Timer0
(RTC), Timer1 (Servo), UART, SPI and TWI.  

Though object-oriented with optional operator overloading syntax
Cosa is between 2-10X faster than Arduino with regard to digital pin
functions. This comes with a small price-tag; memory, 4 bytes per
digital pin and 9 bytes per analog pin. Cosa analog pin objects
holds the latest sample and allows an event handler. See the
benchmarks in the examples directory for further details.

Cosa also contains a data streaming format (Ciao) for encoding of
C/C++ language data types such as strings, integer and floating
pointer numbers into a binary format. It may be used for a number of
applications; tracing, remote procedure calls, data exchange between
Arduino devices, etc. The format allows user data types to be defined
and values exchanged without additional encoding. The stream header
itself is a pre-defined serializable data type. Ciao is used to define
an Arduino monitoring and control language (Cosa fai) which has much
in common with Firmata. See
[CIAO.txt](https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa/blob/master/CIAO.txt)
for more details and the example code (examples/Ciao). 

The primary programming paradigm is object-oriented and
state-machine/event driven with proto-threads. There is a large number
of device drivers available for SPI, TWI/I2C and 1-Wire. A strict
directory structure is used to organize the Cosa/driver source
code. Sub-directories are used for each driver type. This allows a
foundation for scaling and configuration.

Cosa uses the Arduino IDE and build system. Cosa classes are included
with prefix, e.g. "Cosa/FileName.hh". It is possible to use both
Arduino and Cosa functions together, though in some cases the Cosa
objects may become inconsistent. 

To improve debugging and testing there is trace/syslog style support. 
The IOStream class allows output to both serial communication
(UART/VWIO) and small TFT displays (such as the ST7735, ST7564,
HD44780 and PCD8544). The Cosa LCD class extends IOStream::Device with
additional common LCD functions. The drawing Canvas class supports
basic drawing operation and scripting to reduce program memory
footprint. The Canvas class also supports drawing of icons and
multiple fonts (GLCD and UTFT).  

The popular VirtualWire library has been refactored to the
object-oriented style of Cosa and extended with three additional
codecs; Manchester, 4B5B and Fixed Bitstuffing. This allows basic
ultra cheap wireless nodes with RF315/433 receiver and
transmitter. For more advanced wireless connections there is also a
driver for the Nordic Semiconductor NRF24L01+ chip, which allows
low-power wireless communication of up to 2 Mbps in the 2.4GHz band. 

The goal of this project is to provide an efficient programming
platform for rapid prototyping of "Internet-of-things"-devices. 
Unfortunately Cosa is not a beginners entry level programming
platform, though following some of the design patterns in Cosa will
help beginners build more complex small scale embedded systems with
richer concurrency and low power consumption.  

The projects main principle of evolution is iterative with many
rewrites and refactoring. With that said this phase of the project
will require users to align with the interface changes. When
interfaces become stable the project will switch to a normal release
style.

[blogspot](http://cosa-arduino.blogspot.se/) and on the [Arduino
forum](http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,150299.0.html).  

Install
-------

The [Cosa zip file]
(https://github.com/mikaelpatel/Cosa/archive/master.zip) is an Arduino
core package. Download and unzip in your Sketchbook hardware
folder. Create the folder if missing. Restart the Arduino IDE and Cosa
will show up as a number of boards and example sketches.  

For ATtiny a patch is needed for Arduino Windows version to allow
linking programs larger than 4K; See
https://github.com/TCWORLD/ATTinyCore/tree/master/PCREL%20Patch%20for%20GCC. 
Do not forget to program the ATtiny device with the bootloader, i.e.,
set the fuse bits, before using the device for the first time.  

The Application Programmers Interface (API) documentation is available 
[online](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/993383/Cosa/doc/html/index.html) and
compressed for
[download](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/993383/Cosa/doc.zip). The
documentation contains a full hyperlinked description of all functions
in Cosa together with UML graphs of the class hierarchy, include
dependencies, and much more. 

The provided documentation is generated with doxygen and may also be
generated for users source code if the Cosa documentation style is
adapted. See the Doxyfile for configuration of doxygen.
